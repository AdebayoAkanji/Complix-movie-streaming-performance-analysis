In Analysis

In analysis observation

I observe that the male gender uses this service more than the female gender. The dominant country where this service thrives is Canada. From the analysis, the highest customers of the same age bracket is the United states of America. Viewing the analysis dashboard, it is clear that the favorite genre of movie is Comedy. I observed also that the top subscription plan is the Premium Plan 

In analysis insight

Based on the observation, more movies that encourage the male gender should be published. meanwhile, movies that will encourage patronage from the female counterpart should also be encouraged in order to gain them

Canada has more patronage than the other countries, so preference should be made on their favorite genre to encourage them, besides some form of discount should be introduced in that location. However, what encourages the customers in Canada should be discovered and replicated in the other countries for better patronage. 

Based on the analysis, favorite genre is comedy, which means more of this genre of movies needs to be encouraged and made available in excess. We can also check out the favorite genres of movies from other countries so as to encourage them by publishing more of the same.
